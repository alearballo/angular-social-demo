    "description" : "The Holy Bible is the third studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 29 August 1994 through Epic Records. At the time the album was written and recorded, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards was struggling with severe depression, alcohol abuse, self-harm and anorexia nervosa, and its contents are considered by many sources to reflect his mental state. The songs focus on themes relating to politics and human suffering. The Holy Bible was the last of the band's albums released before Edwards' disappearance on 1 February 1995."
