The album spent twenty-two weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 2. Across the Atlantic, it reached No. 28 in Canada on the RPM 100 album chart[1] and No. 70 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990. It has sold consistently well ever since. The album cover, designed by Morrissey, features Alain Delon from the 1964 film L'Insoumis.
